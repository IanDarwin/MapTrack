= MapTrack

This little exercise lets you view a map from OpenStreetMap,
draw a track on it with your finger,
and save the track as a GPX file.
Might be useful in testing a navigator app, for example.
May in fact have no real practical use!

== Layout

This project follows standard Android Studio / Gradle conventions:

Source is in _app/src_

Generated APK is in _app/build_, e.g., 
./app/build/intermediates/instant-run-apk/debug/app-debug.apk

To run the project, just open in Android Studio and run it.

== Usage

* Run the app.
* Adjust the map by dragging, zooming, etc.
* Tap the _Start Drawing_ button.
* Drag to add your track.
* When done, press Save.
The generated filename will be displayed.

== Bugs

Sometimes you have to tape the Start Drawing button twice.

The Clear button clears the data but does not repaint the screen.
